## Document Creation and Editing Tools

Start new documents from templates or blank pages. The editor supports markdown, JSX components, and embeds for interactive content.

<Steps>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Content" icon="edit">
    Use the visual editor for bold, lists, and tables. Switch to source mode for advanced MDX.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Components" icon="layers">
    Insert `<Callout>`, `<Tabs>`, or code blocks directly in the editor.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Preview changes in real-time to ensure your docs render correctly before publishing.
</Callout>

## Version Control for Docs

Every edit creates a new version. You review diffs, restore previous states, and branch for experiments.

```javascript
// Example API to fetch versions
const versions = await fetch('https://api.example.com/docs/{docId}/versions');
const data = await versions.json();
console.log(data.versions); // Array of version objects
```

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  // Revert to specific version
  await fetch(`https://api.example.com/docs/{docId}/revert`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ versionId: 'v1.2.3' })
  });
  ```
  ```python
  # Revert to specific version
  import requests
  requests.post('https://api.example.com/docs/{docId}/revert',
                json={'versionId': 'v1.2.3'})
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Collaboration Features

Invite team members and use comments for feedback. Share public links or embed docs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Comments" icon="message-circle">
    Add inline comments on any text. @mention users for notifications.

    ```markdown

    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sharing" icon="share-2">

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout kind="info">

</Callout>

## Search and Organization

Powerful search indexes all content. Organize with spaces, folders, and tags.

| Feature | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Full-Text Search | Query across titles, body, and metadata | Find API endpoints quickly |
| Folders & Spaces | Nested hierarchy for projects | Group docs by team or version |
| Tags | Custom labels for filtering | Categorize as `internal` or `public` |

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Filters" default-open="false">
  Combine filters like `tag:api AND space:project-v2` for precise results. Use the API for programmatic search:

  ```bash
  curl "https://api.example.com/search?q=authentication&space=docs" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
  ```
